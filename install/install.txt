   4. Driver Installation Procedure
 
 
 1. BEFORE YOU START

   You need a MicroChannel machine with an XGA or XGA-2 display adapter
   and the Windows NT operating system. 
   
   The XGA208 miniport driver XGA2.SYS works with the Windows NT display 
   driver XGA.DLL. You must have the Windows NT XGA driver installed
   before you install the XGA208 miniport driver.

   To differentiate between the Windows NT XGA driver and the XGA208
   miniport driver, the installable types have been defined as:

   "IBM XGA MCA"    = IBM XGA Display Adapter with the XGA208 miniport driver.
   "IBM XGA-2 MCA"  = IBM XGA-2 Display Adapter with the XGA208 miniport driver.

   The Windows NT XGA driver defines the XGA and XGA-2 display types
   as "IBM XGA" and "IBM XGA-2".
   

   MULTIPLE XGA/XGA-2 ADAPTERS
   
   If you have multiple XGA or XGA-2 adapters, only one adapter will be 
   supported. The adapter selection rules are as follows:

    * Planar XGA-2 and one XGA/XGA-2 display adapter in an extension slot.
       
         The adapter in the extension slot is used.
       
    * Planar XGA-2 and multiple XGA/XGA-2 display adapters in extension slots.
    
         The adapter in the LOWEST numbered extension slot used.
         
    * Multiple XGA/XGA-2 display adapters in extension slots.
    
         The adapter in the LOWEST numbered extension slot will be used.

   The additional XGA-2 adapters are not disabled.
 
 
 2. BEFORE YOU INSTALL
      
   MONITOR 
   
   Read the file XGA208MON.TXT and assure yourself that your monitor supports
   the line rates fo the modes you want to use.
   
   XGA APERTURE
   
   Either the 1MB or 4MB XGA video memory aperture must be enabled. The 4MB 
   aperture is enabled per default on PS/2 systems supporting more than 16MB
   of system memory when the XGA resp. XGA-2 is inserted in a 32-bit slot.
   
   If necessary, enable the 1MB aperture using the reference disk. To check
   the status of the aperture, use the XGA-2 utilities, download from here:
  
    	www.members.aon.at/mcabase/pub/files/xga2util.zip
      
   When both apertures are disabled, the driver will exit and NT will start
   in VGA mode. You can deactivate XGA2 and activate XGA in your test profile.
      
     
   HOW TO CREATE A TEST PROFILE ON WINDOWS NT
   
   Follow the outlined procedure to avoid driver conflicts and problems:
    
    - You must have the Windows NT XGA display driver installed before you begin.
    - Make an emergency repair disk with RDISK (enter RDISK)
    - Go to Settings / Control Panel / System. 
    - Create a hardware test profile, e.g. "XGA208 Test Configuration"
    - Boot NT with the created test profile
    - Go to Settings / Control Panel / Devices
    - Search for XGA, find it and click on HW-Profile
    - DEACTIVATE it in the "XGA208 Test Configuration"
    
    - Unzip the downloaded package. 
    - The miniport driver files must be in the directory XGA208NT
    - Install the miniport, same procedure as on W9x, see below
    - Do NOT restart your computer when you are prompted by NT. 
    
    - Go to Settings / Control Panel / Devices
    - Search for XGA2, find it and click on HW-Profile
    - ACTIVATE it in the profile "XGA208 Test Configuration"
    - DEACTIVATE in all other profiles
    
    - Restart your computer
    - Select "XGA208 Test Configuration" profile to boot NT
    - The display will come in VGA mode
    - Select the desired mode
   
    
   LED DISPLAY

   The driver package includes a "television" version of the XGA208 miniport
   driver. It can be used on PS/2 Mod. 95 with a LED display panel. The driver
   will output status messages to the panel. To use this version, make first a
   backup copy of the XGA2.SYS and then copy XGA2.LED to XGA2.SYS. 
   
   IMPORTANT

   Remember to always check the activation status of the XGA and XGA2 drivers
   in the system applet "Devices".
    

 3. DRIVER INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
 
   Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.

   Start the "Display" applet program. 

   Select the "Settings" page, push the "Change Display Type" button.

   Push the "Change" button in the "Adapter Type" area.

   Push the "Have Disk" button and press "OK".

   Specify the path to the driver files and press the <ENTER> key.
   The directory where the miniport files are located is XGA208NT.

       Example 1: Insert the drivers disk in the A: floppy drive,
                  and enter A:\XGA208NT.

       Example 2: Type in the name of the directory where you copied
                  the drivers, either on your local hard drive or
                  on a network share.

       Example 3: If you're not sure exactly where the drivers are,
                  choose the "Browse..." button and find them.

   The "Select Device" dialog box will appear. Select the adapter that
   corresponds to the one you installed in your machine and click OK.
   
   Windows NT will copy the miniport driver to the proper directories
   on your system.
   
   Continue choosing Close until asked to restart your machine from the
   "Systems Settings Change" dialog box.
   
   After the system has restarted, you can go back into the Display applet
   and select the desired display resolution and color depth.

   
END.
